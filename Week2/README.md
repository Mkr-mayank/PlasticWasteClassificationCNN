# Week-2
This is the week 2 of our internship whose project title is "To develop a CNN model to classify images of plastic waste"
<br>
Here we have created CNN for feature extration, and trained the model.
Between this we have learnt about Convolution 2D, Activation functions, MaxPooling2D, Dense layers, Dropout, and Flatten.
These are essential during the construction of hidden layers, to improve efficiency, reduce overfitting and other parameters.
